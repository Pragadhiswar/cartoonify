# cartoonify
This Python script uses OpenCV to apply a cartoon effect to an image. It asks the user for the image name and directory, searches for the image, and then lets the user choose between two cartoon styles. The selected style is applied, and the cartoonified image is displayed in a window using OpenCV.
